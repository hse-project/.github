# HSE: Heterogeneous-Memory Storage Engine

**HSE** is a fast embeddable key-value store designed for SSDs and
persistent memory.
HSE optimizes performance and endurance by orchestrating data
placement across DRAM and multiple classes of solid-state storage.

HSE is ideal for powering Databases, Software-Defined Storage (SDS),
High-Performance Computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), and Machine Learning (ML).
